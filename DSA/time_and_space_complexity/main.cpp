  // Time Complexity means the number of operations performed by an algorithm as a function of input size(n)
  // Big O notation is used to express the upper bound (worst case) of the time complexity of an algorithm

  // Space Complexity means the amount of memory (space) used by an algorithm as a function of input size(n)
  // Big O notation is used to express the upper bound (worst case) of the space complexity of an algorithm

  // We majorly focus on time complexity because in modern systems, it is easier to get extra space (storage is cheaper than time)

  // NOTE: Best to worst time complexity ratings (common ones):
  // O(1): Constant time complexity
  // O(log n): Logarithmic time complexity
  // O(n): Linear time complexity
  // O(n log n): Linearithmic time complexity
  // O(n^2): Quadratic time complexity
  // O(n^3): Cubic time complexity
  // O(2^n): Exponential time complexity
  // O(n!): Factorial time complexity
